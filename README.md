# memtrain
A program for better memory training

memtrain is best used for memorizing short responses (which can be thought of
a what is on the back of a flashcard) to cues (which can be thought of what is
on the front of a flashcard). It is based on the idea that memorization and
learning occur through repetition.

memtrain decreases learning difficulty through gradual familiarization of the
desired responses through three different levels: Level 1 (which involves
automatic generation of multiple choices), Level 2 (in which the user enters
the response with the help of a hint), and Level 3 (in which the user enters
the response). Once Level 3 is mastered, the response to the cue has been
learned successfully.

With memtrain, the user need only create a CSV containing cues and responses.
memtrain does the rest automatically, including generation of multiple choice
questions.
